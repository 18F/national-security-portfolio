# 18Fâ€™s National Security and Intelligence Portfolio

This repo is an index of work in the human services space led by teams within GSA's [Technology Transformation Service (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (which includes [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/)).

## About the National Security and Intelligence Portfolio

The 18F National Security and Intelligence Portfolio is a unit within 18F that will bring together staff to focus on partner projects that relate to the national defense. As part of this work, the portfolio will partner with traditional defense and intelligence agencies, and also with other agencies working on projects that have a clear nexus with national defense. 

## Why a Focus on National Security and Intelligence?

At 18F, we see technical challenges and barriers across government. As an organization, we are well-positioned to help national security and intelligence agencies adopt and apply new technologies more efficiently and more successfully. 

The unique dynamics at work on our national security engagements will help 18F validate and evolve [current practices](https://methods.18f.gov/) and theories of change. How we conduct user research, foster iterative delivery, and advocate for adoption of open source technology are core to our work with agencies. These pillars will be tested rigorously on national security engagements, helping our practices become more adaptable and durable to broaden our impact.

One of the most important outcomes of 18Fâ€™s work assisting agencies in efficiently adopting new technology and digital solutions is improving stewardship of public money. No area of government has the potential to generate these benefits more than in the national security and intelligence area. Our work with defense and intelligence agencies has already generated hundreds of millions of dollars in savings.

Most importantly, we have an opportunity to support the success of agencies responsible for keeping our country safe. When these agencies face challenges fulfilling their mission, our nationâ€™s security is at risk. 18F can have an enormously beneficial impact on the work of these agencies, and - as a result - directly impact our national security and save lives.

- The US Air Force (USAF) is embarking on an ambitious initiative to transform the way it builds and delivers software for its military operations. It has created an organization to focus specifically on this transformation, called Kessel Run, and is rapidly growing its efforts here to deliver value in a user-centered agile fashion. Outside of the agile workshops, this is the first of at least 3 PAs with the Kessel Run team. The main focuses will be: Operating and scaling the multi-region cloud infrastructure platform (based on Cloud Foundry), Paving the path to production for applications, Migrating applications at scale, and Product and project management.
